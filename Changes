	* Meerkat.pm (1.5): 
	
	Many, many documentation changes, with some new examples and
	expanded old examples.
	
	  o Added time parsing -- Can now examine the values passed to the
	    time_period method and turn them into useful examples.
	    time_period understands the following conventions:
	
	    - MINUTE, HOUR, and DAY, with and optional trailing S, in
	      upper or lower case.
	
	    - WEEK/WEEKS?, which are converted to the correct number of
	      DAYs.
	
	    - ALL
	
	    - Each may be preceded by a number, followed by optional
	      whitespace.
	
	    The Meerkat API understands ALL, MINUTE, HOUR, and DAY,
	    preceded by a number (no space).
	
	  o The url() method takes an option $JOINT, on which the
	    parameters are joined; this defaults to the value of
	    the package variable $SEPARATOR, which defaults to '&'.

	* MANIFEST (1.4): Re-sorted, added time parsing test.

	* README (1.3): Updated for new documentation.

	cvs2cl.pl for dlc@tumbleweed

	* Meerkat.pm (1.4): 
	  o Added missing mob method.
	
	  o When flavor() calls get(), no parameters are passed.
	
	  o Added error() method, which works similarly to the error()
	    method that Class::Base / Template::Base provide.
	
	  o get() will look at both @_ and $self->{ __OUTPUT } for a
	    possible destination.
	
	  o The CODE form of get() is wrapped in an eval.
	
	  o Documentation is much more extensive, and a little more
	    well-organized:
	
	    - Meerkat flavors section is now listed after Query Properties
	      and Display Properties sections.	This is different from how
	      the API docs display them, but I think it makes the docs a
	      little easier to read if you've never read them before.
	
	    - The options to get() are finally documented, with some
	examples.
	
	    - Example code is updated to use the OUTPUT version of get(),
	      rather than using > /external/file.
	
	    - The nntp example is removed.

2003-01-07 16:35  darren44

	* Makefile.PL (1.2): Gratuitous blank line removal.

	* README (1.2): Updated with the new contents of Meerkat.pm.

2003-01-07 11:58  darren44

	* Meerkat.pm (1.3): Radical rewrite of most of the internals,
	though the external API remains the same:
	
	  o Options that have a set list of values (sw, t) or limit to the
	    type of value they can take (s) now check for valid types.
	
	  o get() takes an optional destination, which can be a filename,
	    GLOB, object with a print method, or a reference to a string
	    or array.  C.f. Template.pm.
	
	Updated most of the documentation, though the options to get() are
	not documented yet.

2003-01-07 11:54  darren44

	* MANIFEST (1.3), t/get.t (1.1): Added another test.

	* MANIFEST (1.2), Meerkat.pm (1.2), t/instance.t (1.2): Added
	MANIFEST.SKIP to MANIFEST.  get() returns content, rather than
	Response object.  terms() doesn't exclude items that begin with _.
